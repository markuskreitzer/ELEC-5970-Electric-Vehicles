With higher inertia and less stiffness and damping, the overshoot effects of the torque is much more evident for model transients when there's acceleration (change in speed).

With higher slew rate, the simulation was able to reach it target speed faster. This required the torque to three times as high, consistent with the increase of $3\times$ the slew rate.
